# Mouse Mayhem

Mouse Mayhem is my first attempt at windows application programming. Well really, its my first serious attempt at my own software project outside of school. The general idea is a screen sharing application, wherein users can invade other users screens and screw around with them. This could include:
* Grabbing the other person's mouse
* Dropping obstacles for the other person's mouse
* well.. I'm still coming up with ideas

To be honest, the main point of this project is to explore the process of creating my own application, and leveraging all development tools I can find.

Downloads should hopefully be available later on, once its in a usable state.
